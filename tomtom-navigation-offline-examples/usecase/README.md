This example shows how to build a simple offline navigation application using the TomTom Navigation SDK for Android.
The application displays an empty map first, then automatically downloads one or more map regions around the device
location and shows the location. After the user selects a destination with a long tap, the app plans a route and draws it on the map.
Navigation is started once the user taps on the route.
