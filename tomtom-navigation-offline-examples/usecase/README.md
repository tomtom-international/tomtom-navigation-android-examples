This example shows how to build a simple offline navigation application using the TomTom Navigation SDK for Android.
The application displays an empty map first, automatically downloads the tiles around the user location and shows the
user’s location. After the user selects a destination with a long click, the app plans a route and draws it on the map.
Navigation is started once the user taps on the route.
